Algorithms for unconstrained nonlinear optimization. Direct methods Goal

The use of direct methods (one-dimensional methods of exhaustive search, 
dichotomy, golden section search; multidimensional methods of exhaustive search, 
Gauss (coordinate descent), Nelder-Mead) in the tasks of unconstrained nonlinear
optimization
